# 🧠 Sonar Signal Classification with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 🌊⛏️

Welcome to the **Sonar Signal Classification** project! This project demonstrates how to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify sonar signals as either "Rock" or "Mine." Using sonar data, we apply deep learning techniques to solve a binary classification problem.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build and train an ANN model that can:

- Accurately classify sonar signals based on the reflections they produce.
- Distinguish between rocks and mines underwater.

## 📑 Dataset

The dataset used contains sonar signals with 60 input features. Each sample represents sonar readings and is labeled either as:

- **Rock** 🪨 (Class 0)
- **Mine** 🧨 (Class 1)

## 🔨 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is split into training and test sets. Features are scaled to ensure better model performance.
2. **Model Architecture**: We built a fully connected neural network (ANN) with the following details:
   - Input layer with 60 neurons.
   - Multiple hidden layers with the ReLU activation function.
   - An output layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
3. **Training**: The model is trained using the backpropagation algorithm to minimize classification errors.
4. **Evaluation**: Accuracy and other metrics are used to assess the performance on the test data.

## 📊 Model Performance & Results

- **Accuracy**: The trained ANN model achieved an accuracy of **86%** on the test dataset. 
- **Outcome**: The model is effective in classifying sonar signals as either "Rock" or "Mine," making it a valuable tool for identifying underwater objects with high precision.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🔧
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data handling 📊
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations 📉
