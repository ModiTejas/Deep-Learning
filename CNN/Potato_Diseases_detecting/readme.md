# 🥔 Potato Disease Detection Using Deep Learning 🌿

Welcome to the **Potato Disease Detection** project! This repository focuses on classifying potato plant images into three categories—healthy, early blight, and late blight—using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to leverage deep learning to assist in early identification of diseases, enabling timely treatment and improved agricultural outcomes.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Image Classification**: Classify potato leaves as healthy or diseased (Early Blight or Late Blight).  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved ~98% training accuracy and consistent validation accuracy with minimal overfitting.  
- **Deep Learning**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging CNNs to extract and analyze image features.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance dataset diversity and improve model robustness.
