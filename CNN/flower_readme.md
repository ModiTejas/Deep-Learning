# 🌸 Flower Image Classification with CNN & Data Augmentation 🌿

Welcome to my **Flower Image Classification** project! In this repository, I tackle the challenge of classifying flower images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To boost the model's performance and enhance generalization, I've implemented various data augmentation techniques. This project is part of my ongoing journey into the world of deep learning.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Data Augmentation**: Leveraging techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting to expand the training dataset and improve the model’s robustness.
- **CNN Architecture**: A powerful CNN model designed to extract and learn intricate patterns from flower images, leading to accurate classifications.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Detailed analysis and visualization of the model's accuracy and loss, showcasing the impact of data augmentation.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **`data_augmentation_CNN_flower_image_classification_data_augmentations-Copy1.ipynb`**: The core notebook containing the entire workflow—from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Directory to store datasets specific to this project.

## 🏆 Results

- Achieved high accuracy in classifying flower images, demonstrating the effectiveness of the applied data augmentation techniques.
- Visualizations and metrics included to provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ModiTejas/Deep-Learning.git
   cd Deep-Learning/CNN
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
